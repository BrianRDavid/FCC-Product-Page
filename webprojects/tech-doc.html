		<p>
			Monster hunting is a dangerous profession. Hunters put their lives on the line to protect civilization from the many Wyverns that inhabit the world, while doing their best to preserve the balance between man and nature. The biggest factor for a successful hunt is preparation.

		<header>Astera Activities</header>
		<p>
			Astera is the base of operations for all New World activites. It was founded forty years ago by the First Fleet.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li id="Resource_Center">
				The <strong>Resource Center</strong> is the heart of Astera.
				<p>
					The Tech Chief, Provisions Manager, and Analytics Director oversee the day-to-day business of survival and coexistance in the New World. As a Hunter, your interaction with them will mainly involve being issued:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<i>Bounties</i>- When Monster populations become unbalanced, regions require attention, or when provisions are running low, the Resource Center will issue bounties. To incentivize results, completed bounties are rewarded with Armor Spheres, Research Points, and Wyverian Prints. Bounties are the primary source of these, and they won't be awarded until you report in, so be sure to visit often
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>Investigations</i>- These are compiled from the various Wyvern tracks found in the field. They boast better rewards than other quests, and are how you will hunt elusive Tempered Monsters.
					</li>
					<li>
					<i>Delivery Requests</i>- When Astera personnel require specific resources, they file their request at the Resource Center, typically offering unique rewards that Hunters should try their best to acquire.
					</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li id="Ecological_Research">
				The <strong>Ecological Research</strong> team diligently researches New World Fauna.
				<p>
					They will examine wildlife specimens and compile any information which could be helpful into your Monster Field Guide. Such as Monster's known size range, characteristics, habitats, and any useful information that might make a hunt easier. There's a lot more research that goes on, but hunting doesn't require you to be intimately familiar with their gestation period or mating rituals. The relevant duties of the Ecological Research team are:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Classify New Lifeforms
						<code><table>
							<tr>
								<td>Endemic Life</td>
								<td>A blanket term for the non-aggressive Aquatic, Airborne, and Terrestrial Creatures native to the New World.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Small Monsters</td>
								<td>Not as dangerous as a Wyvern, but can pose a threat if provoked</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Piscine Wyverns</td>
								<td>Finned Wyverns which resemble fish, move faster when submerged in a liquid</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Bird Wyverns</td>
								<td>A combination of two subtypes, Therapods and Avians. Typically light-weight, feathered, and less threatening than other wyverns</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Fanged Wyverns</td>
								<td>Quadrupedal wyverns with dangerous teeth and claws</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Brute Wyverns</td>
								<td>Muscular bipedal wyverns with strong legs and short fore-limbs</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Flying Wyverns</td>
								<td>Wyverns with large webbed wings. Though they are called Flying, some species are only capable of short distance gliding</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Elder Dragons</td>
								<td>Do not fall under the above classifcations. Extremely dangerous.</td>
							</tr>
						</table></code>
					</li>
					<li>Probe for Vulnerabilities
						<p>
						When a new species is discovered, and eventually slain, an autopsy will reveal the physiological aspects. The hardness of body parts, what can be broken, whether it reacts strongly to elements. When a specimen is captured alive, other effects can be tested, such as sedatives or toxins.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>Determine Harvestable Materials
						<p>
						The Ecological Research team has categorized Monster Materials into Carves and Rewards. Unfortunately, this is not very intuitive and has left many Hunters confused as to the more effective means of obtaining Gems. The <b><i>Carves</i></b> table lists materials that can quickly be removed from the monster exterior once it is subdued. Capture rewards also come from this list. The <b><i>Rewards</i></b> table lists components gathered when you return to Camp or Astera with the subdued monster in tow. Where a team of hunters will carefully dissect the Monster. They will preserve any useable bones, tissues, fluids, and delicate internal organs the monster possessed. 
						</p>
						<code>
Caution: The Hunter's Guild has recieved reports of Gems missing from the Harvesting Team's results.
Foul play is suspected.
Until the culprit is identified, carve gems yourself before returning from a Hunt.
						</code>
					</li>
					<li>Improve Scoutfly tracking abilities
						<p>
						As scoutflies are exposed to more Monster samples, they'll become better at picking up their trail in the field. Don't be surprised if you find they've forgotten the scent of monsters you haven't hunted in a while. Scoutflies do not have long lifespans, so future generations will have to to be taught anew.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li id="Botanical_Research">
				The <strong>Botanical Research</strong> team studies the Ancient Trees of the New World.
				<p>They have been cultivating an Ancient Tree planted in Astera. The tree itself is an amalgam of many different plants, meaning it can bear multiple types of fruit. And attracts a variety of insects. And many species of fungi grow it.	As a Hunter, they can support you by harvesting specimens for you. Simply inform them of what you could use and they'll gather everything while you're on a hunt. Fertilizer can be purchased with Research Points to improve harvest yield or speed. Consecutive Fertilizer applications will improve the effect and extend the time the Fertilizer will last.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li id="Provisions_Stockpile">
				The <strong>Provisions Stockpile</strong> functions as Astera's general store.
				<p>Hunters can find surplus equipment, non-perishable food, and some niche tools from the mainland. A few of their wares can't be procured through hunting and gathering, and can vastly improve your efficiency in a hunt. So it's a good idea to pay them a visit every time they expand their inventory. In particular, you'll need to purchase these materials from the Stockpile:
				<ul>
					<li>Trap Tools</li>
					<li>Astera Jerky</li>
					<li>Barrels</li>
					<li>Powercharm</li>
					<li>Armorcharm</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li id="Canteen">
				The <strong>Canteen</strong> is often the first stop for new arrivals. 
				<p>
					There's no better place in the New World to sate your appetite. Palicos are known for their culinary abilities, and the Meowscular Chef is no exception. The massive and filling creations that come from his kitchen can inspire hunters to perform incredible feats. Well-Done Steaks are hardly even worth mentioning when compared to the 102 ingredients the Canteen can utilize. If your Canteen isn't fully stocked yet. Check around Astera and the Research Base for any optional quests or deliveries you haven't completed yet. After every hunt, the Canteen will get a new stock of fresh ingredients and with it, new daily food skills. You can use a voucher to guarantee you activate all three skills. Keep an eye out for these two skills in particular, as they can greatly reduce the chance of failure on risky investigations.
					<ul>
						<li>Felyne Insurance - Prevents the first faint on a hunt from counting against mission completion, or reducing the mission rewards.</li>
						<li>Felyne Weakener - Increases the chance of monsters having less health.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li class="sub-section">
				<strong>Tailrider Safaris</strong> really give our Lynian friends a chance to shine.
				<p>
					We humans often forget, but Lynians are proficient hunters in their own right. Palicos fight side-by-side with hunters, Grimalkyne tribes have survived in the New World for centuries. For just a few research points, you can hire these ferocious felynes to put their skills to use. They can gather all sorts of plants, minerals, and mushrooms. Slay and carve monsters. Even research new investigations for you. They can be deployed from the Research Base, or by the caretaker inside your residence.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li class="sub-section">
				The <strong>Argosy</strong> is the only merchant ship willing to brave the stormy sea between the Old and New World.
				<p>
					The voyage there and back takes anywhere from four to six days, after which they'll rest in Astera for three days while they empty their hull. The Captain will set aside three boxes for you to purchase, and you can request that they be filled with a specific category:					
					<ul>
						<li>Materials - A huge variety of monster parts, the rarest up for sale are Bird Wyvern Gems.</li>
						<li>Consumables - Useful for stocking up on the  more uncommon items: Screamer Pods, Dung Pods, Dash Juice and Mega Drugs. Often has the lowest Research Point cost to purchase</li>
						<li>Trade-in items - Allow hunters to quickly convert Research Points for Zenny, but if you're really in need of Zenny you might be better off just selling excess monster parts than waiting for the Argosy to return.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li class="sub-section">
				<p>
					The <strong>Elder Melder</strong> uses the mysterious First Wyverian Melding process to turn things into other things. It defies common sense. She is always experimenting, and will gladly trade anything she's made for new ingredients or vouchers. She'll offer better rates if the melding pot has a low concentration on certain categories of materials.
					If you have the Materials to spare, she will always have these rare consumables for trade:
						<ul>
							<li>Ancient Potion</li>
							<li>Dash Juice</li>
							<li>Mega Demondrug</li>
							<li>Mega Armorskin</li>
							<li>Screamer Pod</li>
						</ul>
					For Wyverian Prints you can acquire these rare Materials:
						<ul>
							<li>Steel Wyverian Print - Uncommon parts from some High Threat Monsters, specifically from Rathian, Rathalos, Diablos, Bazelgeuse, Radobaan and Uragaan. A great way to upgrade your gear when you enter High Rank</li>
							<li>Silver Wyverian Print - Rare Minerals, Relics, Monster Plates, and Elder Dragon Blood</li>
							<li>Gold Wyverian Print - Gems, a fair trade for these rare prints, which Hunters can only acquire as a reward for completing all three Weekly Limited Bounties</li>
						</ul>
						
					As her facility expands, she'll be able to set up her deocration melding pots. She can meld the basic defense and elemental attack or resistance decorations easily. Through a special First Wyverian Ritual, the raw volatile energy contained within Streamstones can be used to produce vastly more powerful decorations. Up to three Feystones can be made with the energy of a single Streamstone. Gleaming Streamstones are the best for this Ritual, and will produce Worn Feystones.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li class="sub-section">
				The <strong>Workshop</strong>'s massive furnace burns day and night to craftequipment.
				<p>
					The Second Fleet Master oversees the Workshop, and will handle any of your equipment related requests. Forge and upgrade weapons, armor, and charms for yourself and your Palico. Nurture Kinsects. Mod Bowguns. Eventually, you will even be able to use Streamstones to augment your equipment to the absolute peak of possibility.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li class="sub-section">
				The <strong>Item Boxes</strong>
				<p>
					are mysterious relics utilizing ancient technology that seem to hold some sort of pocket dimension in which Hunters can safely store and manage excess items and equipment. Their most useful feature is the ability to create and rapidly switch between item and equipment loadouts. They can hold an impressive 40 item loadouts and 112 equipment loadouts. Having a large repitoire of prepared loadouts will enable Hunters to switch to their optimal Monster-countering builds without the lengthy process of individually slotting decorations after every hunt.

				<ul>
					<li>Items and Ammunitions in your Item Pouch, their amount and position, including empty spaces.</li>
					<li>The order of your item bar</li>
					<li>The order of your ammunition and coatings bar</li>
					<li>The Radial Menu configuration</li>
				</ul>
			Loadouts will not save Supply Items or the Materials section of your Item Pouch
			</p>
			<p>It is recommended that you create at least 4 loadouts for each style of play. A Standard loadout for T1-T2 multi-monster hunts, an Elder Dragon loadout which ignores the many items that have little to no effect against them, and a Resupply Loadout for each. Bowgun users should create seperate loadouts that include supplies for ammo types they intend to craft in the field.

				<strong>Equipment Loadouts</strong> can be accessed at the Item Box or Tent. You can create up to 112 different sets. Each set will save and retrieve the following information:
				<ul>
					<li>Weapon, including current Bowgun Mods and Kinsects (but not Kinsect Element)</li>
					<li>Armor</li>
					<li>Charm</li>
					<li>Mantle or Boosters</li>
					<li>Socketed Decorations</li>
					<li>Armor Pigment</li>
				</ul>
				Loadouts will not save layered armor style.				
				It is recommended that you have specific sets saved for monsters that require uncommon skills equipped. Such as Effluvia Resistance for Vaal Hazak, or Thunder and Paralysis Resistance for Kirin. Changing the Armor Pigment for these sets can help differentiate sets that use the same armor pieces.

		<header>The Radial Menu</header>
		<p>
			The Radial Menu is a customizable shortcut system that can set up hotkeys for 36 different actions. In addition to general item use, it enables whetstones to be used without sheating your weapon, can instantly switch ammo types, and quickly crafts items without opening the crafting menu. A Properly set up Radial Menu will save precious seconds navigating your item bar. It will be saved and loaded part of an Item Loadout. After setting up your menu, take care to save it with a loadout so it won't revert back.

			The Item and Ammo bars are the default method for using items in your item pouch. They are infinitly scrolling that display all useable items and ammo types in your Item Pouch, equipped Special Equipment, and Palico Abilities. They can be reordered to better suit a Hunter's preferences. For bowgun users especially, having your most used ammunition types adjacent to each other can save time without taking up Radial Menu hotkeys. When you enter a hunt, your Item Bar will start at the empty space, while the Ammo Bar will start at the top. Both bars are saved and loaded part of an Item Loadout. After setting up your menu, take care to save it with a loadout so it won't revert back.

		<header>The Camps</header>
		<p>
			The Camps are one of the more important resources in a hunt. Wingdrakes can transport you to any camp instantly, so long as you aren't threatened by monsters. Simply open your map and interact with any of the tent icons.
			Once a hunter arrives at camp, they can't be reached by Monsters and should use the opprotunity to heal up and resupply before heading back out to finish the fight. The Tent should be your first stop. It will instantly recover any missing health for you and your palico. Blademasters will note that their blades will also be fully sharpened, while Ranged Weapon Users would do well to use the item manager to resupply any expended ammunition.
			Any absent-minded hunters can rest assured that their team never know if they enter a hunt unprepared, as they'll have the opprotunity to eat, and change their equipment or item loadout.
